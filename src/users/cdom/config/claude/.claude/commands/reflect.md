# Self-Reflection

Do a recap of the important lessons you have learned during this session and
suggestions for self-improvement.

Structure your response as:

1. **Lessons learned** - What went wrong or could have been done better? Be
specific about moments where you struggled, overcomplicated, or speculated
without evidence.

2. **Suggested memory additions** - Concise notes to add to CLAUDE.md or
project documentation that would help future sessions.

After presenting your reflection, ask if the user wants to add it to memory.

Use with /reflect.
