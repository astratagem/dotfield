# Task Immersion Diagram

Draw a visual hierarchy of the nested levels of tasks we are currently working on.

Use a tree structure showing:

- High-level goals at the top
- Sub-tasks indented below
- Status markers (✅ done, ← current position)
- Brief notes on blockers or next steps

Keep it concise. Mark where we are with "←[YOU ARE HERE]".

Use with /immersion.
